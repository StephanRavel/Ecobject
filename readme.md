# Ecobject

Ecology has become one the greatest concerns for the companies and government during the past few decades. But there are so many people and groups who are not convinced about the global warming or the other environmental issues that are at stakes (plastic ocean, biodiversity extinction, etc).  
But being concenscious and conviced does not imply you are aware of all the principal concerns. For instance, how polluting are the objects that we use in our daily lives? Which objects are worse for our planet than others? 

The CO2 emmission of an object tends to be a good indicator of how good or bad is an object for the Earth. The Ecobject project aims to make people aware of this kind of information.
